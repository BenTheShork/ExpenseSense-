# ExpenseSense: Machine Learning Expense Predictor ðŸ§ ðŸ’¸

## Machine Learning Architecture ðŸ¤–

### Predictive Modeling Approach
ExpenseSense employs a sophisticated machine learning pipeline to transform expense tracking:

#### Core Technologies
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
  - Advanced gradient boosting technique
  - Handles complex, non-linear relationships in financial data
- **Prediction Strategy**: Multi-Category Forecasting
  - Separate predictive model for each expense category
  - Captures unique spending patterns across different domains

#### Advanced Feature Engineering
- Temporal feature extraction
  - Year and month-based predictors
  - Seasonal variation detection
- Inflation and economic trend modeling
  - Dynamic adjustment of prediction base values
- Variance and consistency scoring

### Prediction Methodology

#### Model Training Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardized scaling of input features
   - Handling of missing and zero-value entries
   - Temporal feature transformation

2. **Model Training**
   - Cross-validation techniques
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Ensemble learning strategies

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Multifaceted reliability assessment
